First off all, yes, this title couldn't be more clich√© even if it tried. Sometimes you need to start from a strong and foundation, even if it has been abused to death. 

So, with the title cleared out of the way, I'm starting this blog to share some ideas, thoughts and mini-projects that may come along the way. 

I don't expect this blog to become anything important, but if you enjoy whatever I end up writing here, feel welcome.

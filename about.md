Hello! I'm Germ√°n Oviedo, a Industrial Engineer based in Santiago, Chile. Currently I'm working as a Data Scientist@Bci. You can read more about my work and educational experience at my [LinkedIn Profile][linkedin-profile].

I love to tackle new problems and improve old solutions, specially in the realm of Software Engineering and Data & Analytics. My dream is to continue learning about Data Science and to find new areas where to apply said knowledge.

This blog is just a way for me to communicate my thoughts and to showcase some interesting projects along the way.
